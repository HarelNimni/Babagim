My final project in the software engineering major. This is an ordering app from my father's business (Babagim). My idea was to create an app that is customized for my father's business and according to his requests - from the design in the brand colors to adding unique features. For example, I added a feature for personalized ordering, accumulating points, and even a "Follow Us" section that exposes customers to the store's successful TikTok and Instagram pages. The project received a score of 100 from the major's teacher.
